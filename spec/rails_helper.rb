# dummy app's Rails.root is spec/dummy, NOT this engine's own root, so the
# Railtie ends up pointing FactoryBot at the nonexistent
# spec/dummy/spec/factories instead of this engine's real spec/factories.
# The effect: every create(:prompt)/build(:prompt_version)/etc. call in any
# spec raises `KeyError: Factory not registered`, regardless of require
# order. Point FactoryBot at this engine's actual factories directory
# directly rather than relying on the Railtie's Rails.root-relative

# Requires supporting ruby files with custom matchers and macros, etc, in
# spec/support/ and its subdirectories. Files matching `spec/**/*_spec.rb` are
# run as spec files by default. This means that files in spec/support that end
# in _spec.rb will both be required and run as specs, causing the specs to be
# run twice. It is recommended that you do not name files matching this glob to
# end with _spec.rb. You can configure this pattern with the --pattern
# option on the command line or in ~/.rspec, .rspec or `.rspec-local`.
#
# The following line is provided for convenience purposes. It has the downside
# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all files in the support
# directory. Alternatively, in the individual `*_spec.rb` files, manually
# require only the support files necessary.

  # RSpec Rails uses metadata to mix in different behaviours to your tests,
  # for example enabling you to call `get` and `post` in request specs. e.g.:
  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :request do
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #
  # The different available types are documented in the features, such as in
  # https://rspec.info/features/7-1/rspec-rails
  #
  # You can also this infer these behaviours automatically by location, e.g.
  # /spec/models would pull in the same behaviour as `type: :model` but this
  # behaviour is considered legacy and will be removed in a future version.
  #
  # To enable this behaviour uncomment the line below.
  # config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
